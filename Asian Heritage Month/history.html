	<p> Sandra Oh is a 49 year old Korean-Canadian actor and producor, full name Sandra Miju Oh. On July 20, 1971 she was born in Nepean, Ottawa. Her parents were South-Korean immigrants who had traditional jobs as a bio-chemist and a businessman. She also grew up with two siblings, a brother and a sister in a Christian household. From an early age of four she began learning dance, as well as soon later beginning her interest into acting after her parents took her to see Annie on broadway. Throughout her childhood she participated in acting groups, one of those including a comedy troupe from her high school that even went on winning nationals at the Ottawa Improv Games. Also similar to many famous actors today from the East side of Canada,  Oh had a small role in Degrassi High as waitress. </p>

	<p> Being from an Asian-Canadian family Oh was pushed to go on to university and graduate with a degree. Though Oh did not have a drive to go into university and get a traditional degree & job. Instead, against her parents wishes she went to study at the National Theatre School of Canada in Quebec. This was something on the more taboo side of things to do, as pursuing a job in acting was unreasonable at the time. This especially being asian, where asians in media were few from frequent and still are a minority of our western media. Not only that, but in doing this she gave up a four-year scholarship of journalism to Cambridge University. In 1993 Oh graduated from the National Theatre School and moved onto her acting career almost immediately. </p>
	
	<p> In 1996 Oh moved to Hollywood, far from her home to further continue her acting career. There it opened her to a whoel new array of oppourtunities. Since then Oh has been, whether that be acting or voice-acting, in over 45 films. As well as appearing in over 20 tv shows for singular episodes, voice-acting, or for seasons on end. Today Sandra Oh is a notable Asian actress for not only her extraordinary talent and emotion, but also pushing the boundaries and opening the space of western media to be more inclusive to Asians. </p>
